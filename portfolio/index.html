            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> From fields to code, my journey is unique! I am currently sharpening my skills in front end engineering through ALX's Frontend Web Development Certificate. My past experiences in vegetable production and entrepreneurship at Buhle Farmers Academy have polished my business planning and management aptitudes. 
                What truly excites me is the blend of creativity and problem-solving technology offers. I thrive in team settings, whether leading or collaborating. I'm known for being resilient, motivated, and persistently curious â€” always eager to dig deeper and solve the next puzzle through coding.
                As I transition into the tech industry, I am open to mentorships and volunteer opportunities that will bolster my growth and help me contribute meaningfully. My strengths lie in being open-minded, possessing a strong learning agility, and a knack for creative problem-solving.
